# AutoEncoder
"Autoencoding" is a data compression algorithm where the compression and decompression functions are 1) data-specific, 2) lossy, and 3) learned automatically from examples rather than engineered by a human. Additionally, in almost all contexts where the term "autoencoder" is used, the compression and decompression functions are implemented with neural networks.

To build an autoencoder, you need three things: an encoding function, a decoding function, and a distance function between the amount of information loss between the compressed representation of your data and the decompressed representation (i.e. a "loss" function). The encoder and decoder will be chosen to be parametric functions (typically neural networks), and to be differentiable with respect to the distance function, so the parameters of the encoding/decoding functions can be optimize to minimize the reconstruction loss, using Stochastic Gradient Descent. It's simple! And you don't even need to understand any of these words to start using autoencoders in practice.  

Auto-encoders have great potential to be useful and one application is in unsupervised feature learning, where we try to construct a useful feature set from a set of unlabelled images. We could use the code produced by the auto-encoder as a source of features. Another possible use for an auto-encoder is to produce a clustering method â€“ we use the auto-encoder codes to cluster the data. Yet another possible use for an auto-encoder is to generate images. 



## Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder  
The encoder we use here is a 3 layer convolutional network. We can use the convolutional autoencoder to work on an image denoising problem. We will train the autoencoder to map noisy digits images to clean digits images. We add random gaussian noise to the digits from the mnist dataset. The digit looks like this:

## Variational AutoEncoder  
Variational autoencoders are a slightly more modern and interesting take on autoencoding. It's a type of autoencoder with added constraints on the encoded representations being learned. More precisely, it is an autoencoder that learns a latent variable model for its input data. So instead of letting your neural network learn an arbitrary function, you are learning the parameters of a probability distribution modeling your data. If you sample points from this latent distribution, you can generate new input data samples: a VAE is a "generative model".

First, an encoder network turns the input samples x into two parameters in a latent space, which we will note z_mean and z_log_sigma. Then, we randomly sample similar points z from the latent normal distribution that is assumed to generate the data, via z = z_mean + exp(z_log_sigma) * epsilon, where epsilon is a random normal tensor. Finally, a decoder network maps these latent space points back to the original input data.

The parameters of the model are trained via two loss functions: a reconstruction loss forcing the decoded samples to match the initial inputs (just like in our previous autoencoders), and the KL divergence between the learned latent distribution and the prior distribution, acting as a regularization term. You could actually get rid of this latter term entirely, although it does help in learning well-formed latent spaces and reducing overfitting to the training data.  
 Here is a scatter plot of this latent space for the first 5000 images from the test set:

 Each of these colored clusters is a type of digit. Close clusters are digits that are structurally similar (i.e. digits that share information in the latent space).  
  
Because the VAE is a generative model, we can also use it to generate new digits! Here we will scan the latent plane, sampling latent points at regular intervals, and generating the corresponding digit for each of these points. This gives us a visualization of the latent manifold that "generates" the MNIST digits.
